        <p>I am an aspiring & enthusiastic learner who is looking forward to become a Full-stack Web Developer.<br />
            After many failed mindset attempts,I was pretty much able to understand that if one gets the proper teaching and guidance then he/she can do anything.<br />    
        </p>
        <p>Thanks to the courses of Dr. Angela Yu that she teaches amazingly in a very interesting and understanding way <br />
            that I am very much confident and motivated back then and now today also.<br />
        </p>    
        <p>I belieive that there must be someone who wants to hire me on the basis of my human nature and skills and not on any degree.<br />
            My skills and portfolio projects are represented as ahead in this Resume.<br />
